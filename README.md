##Info

This project uses node.js to generate Java code. Sorry. It sources the information from a PSD and CSV file and uses that to generate the java code for the following files:

- src\main\java\HeroicArmory\init\ModItems.java
- src\main\resources\assets\heroicarmory\loot_tables\loot.json
- src\main\resources\assets\heroicarmory\loot_tables\en_US.lang

As well as generating all of the models and textures.
